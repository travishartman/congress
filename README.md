Under construction for visualization for the Legislative Effectivness Score by political scientists Voldman and Wiseman.

There are many potential avenues to attack in the presentation of the information.  The website does a pretty good job with the map, but there are rich veins to mine yet.  Visual explanations of the statistical methods, visualizations of the individual congressman's records through their tenure and potentially incorporating the benchmark score into the final project would be ideal.  Dovetails nicely with an existing Graphicicay project on the political standing of representatives throughout our national history seen here: http://graphicacy.com/house-interactive/

improvements to come:

combobox / search
listing of rep/dem split
stylized timeline slider
explainer text / statistical breakdown of LES
Key / legend
