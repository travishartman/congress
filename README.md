Under construction for visualization for the Legislative Effectivness Score by political scientists Voldman and Wiseman.

Many potentail avenues to attack in the presentation of the information.  The website does a pretty good job with the map, but I think there are rich veins to mine yet.  Visual explanations of the statistical methods, visualziations of the individual congressman's records through their tenure and potentially incpororating the benchmark score into the final project would be ideal.  Dovetails nicely with an existing Graphicicay project on the political standing of represenatives throughout our nationsl history seen here: http://graphicacy.com/house-interactive/
more improvemnts to come.
